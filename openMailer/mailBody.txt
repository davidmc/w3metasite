Hello,

This is a test.

We are verifying the functionality of the new W3 Systems Design SMTP mail software.
This is a replacement for our original software that 'forked' a sendmail process.
The sendmail process worked fine, but did not give us the kind of capability we needed to verify mailboxes and assure 'real time' that mail was sent.

If you get this mail, please reply to davidmc@w3sys.com

Thanks! David McCombs.
