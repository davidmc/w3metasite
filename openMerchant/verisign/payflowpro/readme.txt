Obtaining an Internet Merchant Account
--------------------------------------
Working with a Financial Institution:	

To process credit cards, you must obtain an Internet merchant account from a 
bank. Not all banks support Internet credit card processing, for this reason 
Verisign Payment Services has established relationships with the many institutions to 
assist merchants in establishing Internet merchant accounts.


If You Have an Existing Bank Relationship:

First Data Corporation (FDC) - FDC operates a credit card processing network 
which is used by many banks. FDC can help you obtain a merchant account for 
the following situations:

* If you have a merchant account and are currently authorized to accept credit 
  cards, but are not authorized for Internet transactions or,

* If you are currently authorized by your bank to accept credit cards and are 
  not sure if your existing bank supports Internet processing, FDC will work 
  with your bank to establish this process.  

If you are in one of the above categories, fill out the form at the end of this
document and fax or email to FDC. Make sure the information on the form is 
complete.

If You Do Not Have a Bank Relationship:

Wells Fargo Bank - Wells Fargo takes a proactive approach in helping new 
merchants establish Internet merchant accounts for credit card processing. If 
you do not currently accept credit cards, and would like to use Wells Fargo, 
request a Wells Fargo Merchant Application form from Debra Carraway at 
carraway@wellsfargo.com.  

When you fill out a merchant application you will need to specify the software 
you are using for processing, specify Payflow Pro Client.


Obtaining Merchant ID Numbers

When the bank has completed your account setup, the bank will supply you with a
Merchant Identification (MID) number and terminal identification number (TID) 
that is used by Verisign Payment Services to configure your site for credit card 
processing. You will need to supply these numbers to Verisign Payment Services
when you complete your registration.

Credit Card Processing Overview
-------------------------------
The life of a credit card transaction represents at least two steps - 
authorization, then settlement, also known as capture. In simple terms, a 
merchant needs positive confirmation that the merchant is going to get paid
for goods shipped or services rendered, since no cash is changing hands.  
Authorization provides this guarantee, in the form of an auth code, but does 
not initiate actual payment to the merchant.  From the merchant's perspective, 
an auth code is like a promissory note - he/she could bring it to the bank, and
get cash for it in return.  

Settlement is the natural final step in the life of a credit card transaction; 
akin to the merchant going to the bank, and trading an auth code for cash.  
Realistically, the merchant 'settles' a batch of auth codes once a day, and 
funds are deposited into the merchant's account. Although the key step in any 
credit card transaction  - this is the step that ensures the merchant is paid 
for the goods or services - it is fairly simple in concept.  All transactions 
ready for settlement (sometimes referred to as 'posting'), are sent as records 
to the processing host, where they are stored in a capture database.  

It is the responsibility of the interface system (such as Payflow Pro Client 
Gateway Processing service) to ensure both reliable transport to the host, as 
well as data content, as required by the credit card and banking industries. 
Payflow Pro Client provides the services to ensure authorization and capture of 
funds with your credit card processor.
