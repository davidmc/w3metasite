THIS EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS EFFECTIVE EVEN IF THE EXCLUSIVE REMEDY STATED IN SECTION 9 ABOVE FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.  

        Section 11.  Indemnification.  You will, at Your sole cost and expense, defend, indemnify and hold harmless, FedEx, its parent corporation, its subsidiaries and branches and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns from all claims, demands, suits, damages, costs, expenses, suits, fines and judgements, including reasonable attorneys fees, (collectively hereinafter "Claims") arising out of Your installation, use and removal of API and the Materials.

You will not settle any such action involving FedEx or API without the prior written consent of FedEx.  

        Section 12.  Controlling Law and Severability.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States and the State of Tennessee, excluding its conflict of laws provision.  If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Agreement, or a portion thereof, to be nt, the transportation agreement, tariff, Service Guide, Standard Conditions of Carriage, or this Agreement will control, in that order of priority.  No one is authorized to alter or modify the terms of our agreement regarding a Shipment.  The Air Waybill shall be binding on FedEx and You when the Shipment is accepted; FedEx may mark the Air Waybill with an employee number as its signature, or its printed name shall be sufficient to constitute FedEx's signature of the Air Waybill.  If a Shipment originates outside the United States, the contract of carriage is with the FedEx subsidiary, branch, or independent contractor who originally accepts the Shipment.  

(e) In the event You use the Equipment to process Shipments tendered to FedEx for delivery to locations outside the United States or country of Shipment origin, You will, at Your sole expense, assure that the terms and conditions of international carriage supplied by FedEx from time to time (which may be amended or modified from time to time at FedEx's sole discretion) are placed on the Air Waybill or Label for all such international Shipments in a manner acceptable to FedEx.  You will defend, indemnify and hold harmless FedEx, its officers, directors, employees and agents from and against any and all losses, damages, claims and other items of cost and expense arising out of Your failure to apply the international carriage terms to the Air Waybill for such international Shipments, including without limitation claims from the recipient of any Shipment, and Your failure to follow FedEx's instructions in regard to the placement of the terms on the Air Waybills for such international Shipments.  

(f) Printed Signature.  You acknowledge that if the Equipment is used to process Shipments to locations outside the United States or country of Shipment origin, You must and will enter, to print in lieu of a manual signature on the international Air Waybills, Pick-up Records, Labels or Manifests, as applicable, the name of the person completing the Air Waybills, Labels, Manifests or Pick-Up Records for all Shipments tendered by You to FedEx using the Equipment.  You further acknowledge that such printed name shall be sufficient to constitute Your signature, and Your acceptance of FedEx's terms and conditions of carriage contained in the applicable transportation agreement, Service Guide, Standard Conditions, tariff, Air Waybill, or transportation agreement under which the Shipment is accepted by FedEx, or its independent contractor. 

(g)  Warranty.  You warrant that each article in each Shipment will be properly described on the Air Waybill and on any export documents, is acceptable for transport by FedEx, and that the Shipment will be properly marked, addressed and packed to ensure safe transportation with ordinary care in handling.  You are responsible for all charges, including transportation charges and all duties, customs assessments, governmental penalties and fines, taxes and FedEx legal costs related to Your Shipments. 

 (h)  Air Carriage Notice.  If the carriage of Your Shipment by air involves an ultimate destination or stop in a country other than the country of departure, the Warsaw Convention, and any of its subsequent amendments and protocols, (collectively "Warsaw Convention") may be applicable and govern and in most cases limit FedEx's liability for loss, delay of or damage to Your Shipment.  In certain countries, the Warsaw Convention limits FedEx's liability to U.S. $9.07 per pound (U.S. $20.38 per kilogram or equivalent local currency), unless a higher value for carriage is declared as described below and You pay any applicable supplementary charges.  In Canada, the Warsaw Convention may limit liability to the Canadian dollar equivalent of 250 French Francs of 65.5 milligrams gold of millesimal fineness 900 per kilogram, unless a higher value of carriage is declared as described below and You pay any applicable supplementary charges.  The interpretation and operation of the Warsaw Convention's liability limits may vary in each country.  There are no specific stopping places which are agreed to and FedEx reserves the right to route Shipments in any way FedEx deems appropriate. 

(i)  Road Transport Notice.  Shipments transported solely by road, be there an explicit agreement to do so or not, into, or from a country which is a party to the Convention on the Contract for the International Carriage of Goods by Road (the "CMR") are subject to the terms and conditions of the CMR, notwithstanding any other provisions referred to or in the Air Waybill to the contrary, except that the higher limitations of liability as set forth in the Air Waybill conditions shall remain applicable as opposed to those set forth in the CMR.  

(j)  Limitation of Liability.  If not governed by the Warsaw Convention, the CMR, or other international treaties, laws, government regulations, orders or requirements, FedEx's maximum liability for loss, delay of or damage to Your Shipments is limited to the greater of the amount of U.S. $100 per Shipment or U.S. $9.07 per pound (U.S. $20.38 per kilo) (or equivalent local currency for the country of origin), (or in Canada, the amount of actual damages or CDN $100 per Shipment, whichever is less), unless You declare, in advance, a higher value for carriage as described below and pays any applicable supplementary charges.  If You declare a higher value, You must pay an additional charge for each additional US$100 (or the equivalent in local currency) (or in Canada CAN$100) of declared value for carriage.  Please call FedEx or refer to the applicable FedEx rate sheets in effect at the time of Shipment for an explanation on the additional charge.  If You declare a higher value for carriage and pays the additional charge, FedEx's maximum liability will be the lesser of the declared value for carriage or Your actual damages.  FedEx does not provide cargo liability or all-risk insurance. For packages tendered for FedEx Ground services please reference the applicable service guide

(k)  Declared Value Limits.  The highest declared value FedEx allows for a FedEx Letter/FedEx Envelope and FedEx Pak Shipment is US$100 or US$9.07 per pound (US$20.38 per kilo)(or the equivalent in local currency), whichever is greater.  In Canada, the maximum declared value allowed for customs and carriage per Air Waybill for each FedEx Letter and FedEx Pak is CAN$100.  For other Shipments, in particular Shipments of extraordinary value, including, but not limited to jewelry, artwork, antiques, precious metals, and furs and fur clothing, the declared value of carriage is limited and depends on the contents and the destination of the Shipment.  Please check the applicable Service Guide, contract of carriage, transportation agreement, tariff, or Standard Conditions for an explanation of the declared value limits.  If You send more than one Package using a single Air Waybill, the declared value for carriage of each Package will be determined by dividing the total declared value for carriage by the number of Packages in the Shipment. For packages tendered for FedEx Ground services please reference the applicable service guide. 

(l)  Liabilities Not Assumed.  IN ANY EVENT, SUBJECT TO THE SERVICE CONDITIONS ON THE AIR WAYBILL, AND IN THE APPLICABLE SERVICE GUIDE, TRANSPORTATION AGREEMENT, STANDARD CONDITIONS, TARIFF OR CONTRACT OF CARRIAGE, FedEx WON'T BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL, IN EXCESS OF THE DECLARED VALUE US$100 OR US$9.07 PER LB. (US$20.38 PER KILO) (OR THE EQUIVALENT IN LOCAL CURRENCY) WHICHEVER IS GREATER (OR IN CANADA IN EXCESS OF THE DECLARED VALUE FOR CARRIAGE) (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF INCOME OR PROFITS) WHETHER OR NOT FedEx HAD ANY KNOWLEDGE THAT SUCH DAMAGES MIGHT BE INCURRED.

The Warsaw Convention provides that written claims for damage must be received within fourteen (14) days from the date of receipt and within twenty-one (21) days in the event of delay.  FedEx may have expanded the claims periods in certain countries and the periods may differ from country to country.  Moreover, the interpretation and operation of the Warsaw Convention’s claims provisions may vary in each country.  Contact the FedEx representative in the country of origin to determine the claims period for Your Shipment.  In the event of nondelivery or misdelivery, misinformation, or failure to provide information, FedEx must receive written notice of the claim within ninety (90) days after FedEx accepts the Shipment.

Within ninety (90) days after notification to FedEx of the claim, it must be documented by sending FedEx all relevant information about it.  FedEx is not obligated to act on any claim until all transportation charges have been paid;  the claim amount may not be deducted from those transportation charges.  If the recipient accepts the Shipment without noting any damage on the delivery record, FedEx will assume the Shipment was delivered in good condition.

However, FedEx is not obligated to do so.  If a substitute form of air waybill is needed to complete delivery of Your Shipment and FedEx completes that document, the terms of this Agreement will continue to govern.  FedEx is not liable to You or any other person for FedEx's actions on Your behalf under this provision.  

(s)  Items Not Acceptable for Transportation.  FedEx does not accept transportation of money (including, but not limited to, coins (except collectible) or negotiable instruments equivalent to cash such as endorsed stocks and bonds.)

 (h)  Air Carriage Notice.  If the carriage of Your Shipment by air involves an ultimate destination or stop in a country other than the country of departure, the Warsaw Convention, and any of its subsequent amendments and protocols, (collectively "Warsaw Convention") may be applicable and govern and in most cases limit FedEx's liability for loss, delay of or damage to Your Shipment.

In Canada, the Warsaw Convention may limit liability to the Canadian dollar equivalent of 250 French Francs of 65.5 milligrams gold of millesimal fineness 900 per kilogram, unless a higher value of carriage is declared as described below and You pay any applicable supplementary charges.  The interpretation and operation of the Warsaw Convention's liability limits may vary in each country.

Shipments transported solely by road, be there an explicit agreement to do so or not, into, or from a country which is a party to the Convention on the Contract for the International Carriage of Goods by Road (the "CMR") are subject to the terms and conditions of the CMR, notwithstanding any other provisions referred to or in the Air Waybill to the contrary, except that the higher limitations of liability as set forth in the Air Waybill conditions shall remain applicable as opposed to those set forth in the CMR.  

(j)  Limitation of Liability.  If not governed by the Warsaw Convention, the CMR, or other international treaties, laws, government regulations, orders or requirements, FedEx's maximum liability for loss, delay of or damage to Your Shipments is limited to the greater of the amount of U.S. $100 per Shipment or U.S. $9.07 per pound (U.S. $20.38 per kilo) (or equivalent local currency for the country of origin), (or in Canada, the amount of actual damages or CDN $100 per Shipment, whichever is less), unless You declare, in advance, a higher value for carriage as described below and pays any applicable supplementary charges.  If You declare a higher value, You must pay an additional charge for each additional US$100 (or the equivalent in local currency) (or in Canada CAN$100) of declared value for carriage.  Please call FedEx or refer to the applicable FedEx rate sheets in effect at the time of Shipment for an explanation on the additional charge.

The highest declared value FedEx allows for a FedEx Letter/FedEx Envelope and FedEx Pak Shipment is US$100 or US$9.07 per pound (US$20.38 per kilo)(or the equivalent in local currency), whichever is greater.

For other Shipments, in particular Shipments of extraordinary value, including, but not limited to jewelry, artwork, antiques, precious metals, and furs and fur clothing, the declared value of carriage is limited and depends on the contents and the destination of the Shipment.  Please check the applicable Service Guide, contract of carriage, transportation agreement, tariff, or Standard Conditions for an explanation of the declared value limits.  If You send more than one Package using a single Air Waybill, the declared value for carriage of each Package will be determined by dividing the total declared value for carriage by the number of Packages in the Shipment. For packages tendered for FedEx Ground services please reference the applicable service guide. 

(l)  Liabilities Not Assumed.  IN ANY EVENT, SUBJECT TO THE SERVICE CONDITIONS ON THE AIR WAYBILL, AND IN THE APPLICABLE SERVICE GUIDE, TRANSPORTATION AGREEMENT, STANDARD CONDITIONS, TARIFF OR CONTRACT OF CARRIAGE, FedEx WON'T BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL, IN EXCESS OF THE DECLARED VALUE US$100 OR US$9.07 PER LB.

The Warsaw Convention provides that written claims for damage must be received within fourteen (14) days from the date of receipt and within twenty-one (21) days in the event of delay.  FedEx may have expanded the claims periods in certain countries and the periods may differ from country to country.  Moreover, the interpretation and operation of the Warsaw Convention’s claims provisions may vary in each country.  Contact the FedEx representative in the country of origin to determine the claims period for Your Shipment.  In the event of nondelivery or misdelivery, misinformation, or failure to provide information, FedEx must receive written notice of the claim within ninety (90) days after FedEx accepts the Shipment.
