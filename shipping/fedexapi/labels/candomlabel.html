<P>DEFINITIONS. On this Air Waybill, "we", "our", "us", and "FedEx" refer to Federal Express Canada Ltd., its principals, subsidiaries, branches and affiliates and their respective employees, agents, and independentcontractors. The terms "you" and "your" include the shipper, sender, recipient/consignee, and their respective employees, principals, agents and independent contractors. The term "package" means any container or envelope that is accepted by us for delivery, including any such items tendered by you utilizing our automated systems, meters, manifests or waybills. The term "shipment" means all packages which are tendered to and accepted by us on a single Air Waybill. AGREEMENT TO TERMS. By processing and giving us your shipment, you agree, regardless of whether you sign this Air Waybill, for yourself and as agent for and on behalf of any other person having an interest in this shipment, to all terms on this NON-NEGOTIABLE Air Waybill produced by API, in any applicable tariff, and in our current Worldwide Service Guide (our Worldwide Service Guide can be unilaterally modified, amended or supplemented by us without notice) or Standard Conditions of Carriage, copies of which are available upon request. If there is a conflict between this Air Waybill and either the tariff, Worldwide Service Guide, Standard Conditions of Carriage or any customer automation agreement, the terms and conditions of the tariff, Worldwide Service Guide or Standard Conditions of Carriage or customer automation agreement will prevail, in that order of priority. No one is authorized to alter or modify the terms of our agreement.

YOUR OBLIGATIONS - PRINTED SIGNATURE. You warrant that each article in each shipment will be properly described on the Air Waybill and on any accompanying documentation, is acceptable for transport by FedEx, and that the shipment is properly marked, addressed and packed to ensure safe transportation with ordinary care in handling. You, the shipper, will always be primarily responsible for all charges including transportation charges, and all duties, assessments, governmental penalties and fines, taxes and our legal fees and costs, related to your shipment. Further and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you shall indemnify us and hold us harmless against all liabilities, losses, claims, damages, costs and expenses of any nature whatsoever, incurred as a consequence of your non-observance of any applicable laws, government regulations or requirements. ROAD TRANSPORT NOTICE. Any carriage of your shipment by road may be subject to Federal and Provincial laws, regulations, orders or requirements which may govern and serve to limit our liability for damage, loss, delay, shortage, mis-delivery, nondelivery, misinformation or failure to provide information in connection with your shipment. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. If not governed by Federal or Provincial laws, regulations, orders, or requirements as described above, FedEx's maximum liability for damage, loss, delay, shortage, mis-delivery, nondelivery, misinformation or failure to provide information in connection with your shipment, even if caused by our negligence or gross negligence, is limited by this Agreement to CDN $100 per shipment, unless you declare in advance a higher value for carriage as described below, and pay any applicable supplementary charge. FedEx does not provide cargo liability or all-risk insurance, but you may pay an additional charge for each additional CDN $100 of declared value for carriage. If a higher value for carriage is declared and the additional charge is paid, FedEx's maximum liability will be the lesser of the declared value for carriage or your actual damages.

DECLARED VALUE LIMITS. Shipments containing items of extraordinary value are limited to a maximum declared value for carriage of CDN $500. The maximum declared value we allow for carriage per air waybill for each FedEx® Letter or FedEx® Pak is CDN $100. Please check the current Worldwide Service Guide and any applicable tariff for further explanation of the declared value limits. If you send more than one package on this Air Waybill, the declared value for carriage of each package will be determined by dividing the total declared value for carriage by the number of packages in the shipment. LIABILITIES NOT ASSUMED. IN ANY EVENT, FEDEX WON'T BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL, (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF INCOME OR PROFITS) IN EXCESS OF THE DECLARED VALUE FOR CARRIAGE OR CDN $100, WHICHEVER IS APPLICABLE, WHETHER OR NOT FEDEX HAD ANY KNOWLEDGE THAT SUCH DAMAGES MIGHT BE INCURRED. FedEx won't be liable for your acts or omissions, including but not limited to, incorrect declaration of the shipment, improper or insufficient packing, securing, marking or addressing of the shipment, or for the acts or omissions of the recipient or anyone else with an interest in the shipment. FedEx won't be liable for damage, loss, delay, shortage, mis-delivery, nondelivery, misinformation or failure to provide information in connection with shipments of cash, currency or other prohibited items. Also, FedEx won't be liable if you or the recipient violate any of the terms of this Agreement. FedEx won't be liable for loss, damage, delay, shortage, mis-delivery, nondelivery, misinformation or failure to provide information in connection with your shipment caused by events FedEx cannot control, including but not limited to, acts of God, perils of the air, weather conditions, acts of public enemies, war, strikes, civil commotions, or acts or omissions of public authorities (including customs and health officials) with actual or apparent authority. You should contact an insurance agent or broker if insurance coverage is desired. We do not provide insurance coverage of any kind. NO WARRANTIES. We make no warranties, express or implied. CLAIM FOR LOSS, DAMAGE OR DELAY. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE MADE IN WRITING AND WITHIN STRICT TIME LIMITS. SEE OUR CURRENT WORLDWIDE SERVICE GUIDE AND ANY APPLICABLE TARIFF FOR DETAILS. We must receive your written notice of a claim for damage or delay, including perishable and spoilage damage claims due to late or delayed delivery, within 21 days after we deliver your shipment and in the case of loss, shortage, mis-delivery, nondelivery, misinformation or failure to provide information, within 90 days after we accept the shipment for carriage. The right to claim damages against us shall be extinguished unless an action is brought within two years from the date of delivery of the shipment or from the date on which the shipment should have been delivered or from the date on which the carriage stopped. Within 90 days after you have notified us of your claim, it must be documented by sending us all relevant information regarding your claim. FedEx is not obligated to act on any claim until all transportation charges have been paid. The claim amount may not be deducted from these charges. If the recipient accepts the shipment without noting any damage on the delivery record, FedEx will assume the shipment was delivered in good condition. In order for us to consider a claim for damage, the contents, original shipping carton and packing must be made available to us for inspection at the delivery location and you must retain all such item until the claim is concluded. RIGHT TO INSPECT. Your shipments may, at FedEx's option, or at the request of governmental authorities, be opened and inspected by FedEx or such authorities at anytime.

RESPONSIBILITY FOR PAYMENT. Even if you give us different payment instructions, you, the shipper, will always be primarily responsible for all charges, including transportation charges, and all duties, assessments, governmental penalties and fines, taxes, and FedEx's legal fees and costs related to shipments tendered under this Agreement. You also will be responsible for any costs FedEx may incur in returning your shipments to you or warehousing them pending disposition. LETTER OF INSTRUCTION. If you do not complete all the documents required for carriage or if the documents submitted are not appropriate for the services or destination requested, you hereby instruct FedEx, where permitted by law, to complete, correct or replace the documents for you at your expense. However, FedEx is not obligated to do so. If a substitute form of Air Waybill is needed to complete delivery of your shipment and FedEx completes that document, the terms of this Agreement will continue to govern. FedEx is not liable to you or any other person for FedEx's actions on your behalf under this provision. ITEMS NOT ACCEPTABLE FOR TRANSPORTATION. FedEx will not accept certain items for carriage, and other items may be accepted for carriage only to limited destinations or under restricted conditions. FedEx reserves the right to reject packages based upon these limitations or for reasons of safety or security. Consult the Worldwide Service Guide and any applicable tariff for details. AIR WAYBILL FORMAT AND DESIGN. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, FedEx agrees to permit you to generate on your equipment FedEx Air Waybills for your sole use, subject at all times to the prior written approval of FedEx of the format, content and layout of such Air Waybill. You agree to immediately discontinue producing such Air Waybills at any time upon request by FedEx. MANDATORY LAW. Insofar as any provisions contained or referred to in this Agreement may be contrary to any applicable laws, government regulations, orders or requirements, such other provisions shall remain in effect as a part of this Agreement to the extent that they are not overridden. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provisions of this Agreement shall not affect any other part hereof. The parties expressly agree that this Agreement be drawn up in the English language.
