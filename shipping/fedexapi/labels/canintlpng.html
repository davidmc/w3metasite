If there is a conflict between the Air Waybill and any such document then in effect for the country where the shipment originates, the terms of the applicable FedEx transportation agreement, tariff, FedEx Service Guide, or Standard Conditions of Carriage will prevail, in that order of priority. No one is authorized to alter or modify the terms of our agreement.
